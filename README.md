## ðŸš€ Features
- Graph modeling of financial transactions
- Degree distribution analysis
- PageRank-based influential transaction discovery
- Louvain community detection for suspicious groups
- Integration with Python (Neo4j Python driver + Pandas)

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- `Transaction_Fraud_Detection_with_Neo4j.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all steps from data loading to graph analysis.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Neo4j (with GDS plugin)
- Python packages:
  ```bash
